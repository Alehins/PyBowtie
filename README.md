PyBowtie
========

##Purpose:
* The goal is to create a seamless integration between phone sensor data and robotics applications. 
* Small scale robotics has suffered because of a lack of sensor data due to cost and CPU pin compatability
* Bowtie offers a cheaper solution where the developer only needs a smart phone and an internet connection on the robot

##To run:
* The server: make run_server
* The CPU client: make run_client

##Requirements:
* Pip:
	* easy_install pip
* Flask:
	* pip install flask
