#Bowtie Meeting Notes
##21-06-2013

We discussed the language choice and have settled on using Go for the server side. We also delegated what parts of the project will be done by different individuals.

##Project Details:
###Alexey and Alex
- Implement the RESTFUL API on the server side
- Add bindings to high use languages
- Add more visualization functionality
	- Google maps 
	- Establish a way to display data for tilt such that it is useful to the user

###Christopher
- Get the microphone and webcam data to be streamed from the producer to the server.
- Allow a consumer to pull the stream from the server.
- Work in cohesion with Alexey and Alex to display this data on the visualization

###EXTRA TODO
- Add a license file to the repo
